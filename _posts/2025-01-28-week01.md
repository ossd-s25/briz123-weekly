title: Week 1 - Open Source Introduction

## Open Source
------

The first word that comes to mind when I think of the term "open source" is collaboration.

<!--more-->

Open source allows for all those who are knowledgeable about a subject to contribute and redistribute information in an accessible way. It allows for a greater depth of understanding about a topic. Closed source is also advantageous because it allows for higher security and consistency of a project.

I chose to learn more about open source software development because I think that I will value the experience of having small contributions have a greater impact than I would have on personal smaller projects.



### Projects
------
 - [ Internet Archive ](https://github.com/internetarchive)  is "the library of the Internet" that I have used in the past to access books that I would otherwise not have access to.

 -  [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) is an IDE that I use throughout all of my computer science courses.

 - [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) is a JS framework that I have briefly used in the past and that I find can be utilized to create beautiful applications.

 - [Blender](https://github.com/blender) is a tool I have not yet used but am excited to explore as graphics is a field I have not yet had time to explore.
