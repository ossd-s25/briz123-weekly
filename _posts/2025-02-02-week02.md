## Code of Conduct 

An important part of open source projects is the code of conduct. It's a clear and reliable guide for users and contributers to interact with each other,the product,and the code.

Projects benefit from a code of conduct because it increases clarity about the projects values. A common template is that of [The Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct). Some projects like the [Go project](https://golang.org/) have more explicit procedures for the enforcement for their code of conduct because it allows for conflict resolution in a way that is personalized and beneficial to that specific project.

Another interesting code of conduct is that of [Sugar Labs](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_Labs/Legal/Code_of_Conduct). It is different in that it adds instruction on "stepping down" to minimize disruption and its based on the [Ubunto Code of Conduct](https://ubuntu.com/community/ethos/code-of-conduct).

[FreeCodeCamp](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp) is a project dedicated to helping others learn how to code. Its [Code of Conduct](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/code-of-conduct) differs from the previous examples in that it provides a reference to a moderator team that recieves complaints. It also explicitly prohibits bots without prior permission.
