## Lucide Progress
------

My team has made a lot of progress on our presentation. We now have 90% of our slides made and ready to go.

One thing that we are working on is practicing and rehearsing for our big day. After going through a dry run today we have consolidated some od our slides in order to save time. As far as contributions go, I believe that today was our last day where we made any to Lucide. This is believed to be necessary so we can adequately focus on preparing to present.


### Preswald Reflection
------
After seeing the presentation for Preswald I was extremely impressed by how much work they have gotten done this semester. It seemed that due to the youthful nature of the project they were able to add contributions in the form of adding features was a direct contrast to my experience at Lucide. 

My favorite contribution for their project was that of the debugger. I do not think that I would have been able to implement that myself. I was also inspired by their work on the chatbot feature and I admired how even though they had setbacks with it, they adapted by looking into what already existed in the codebase and worked based off that.

another thing i liked was their sense of teamwork, splitting into groups of two was truly the best decision for them and its admirable they made that change early on.
