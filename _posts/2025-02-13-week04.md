Make your blog post for the week.
Comment on the git exercises we did in class.
Comment presentations and extensions created by other groups.
What was a biggest take-away from your own group work and from watching other groups.


## Version Control

Version Control Systems are important in allowing developers to safely interact with code. It is not a flawless system but it allows for mistakes to be made in a way in which they can be undone which is extremely useful for everyone involved in production.

One can create, initialize, and clone a repository without ever really needing to know git commands by using certain IDEs and github but knowing and being familiar with these commands helps to understand the mechanics of git. For example `git status` is a much quicker way of seeing that there are untracked files rather than looking through your repository on github. 

Another great command to know is `git restore` which allows us to "undo" changes that have been made since the last commit. Furthermore being able to create a branch, work on it, then merge it to the origin later is an amazing tool for large group projects where many changes are being made.

## Extensions

I was recently able to view some open source presentations that have been newly developed and would love to share some comments about them.

1. [Virtual Pet](https://github.com/ossd-s25/Team2-add-on-ScreenPet) was an exciting project that brought the concept of Tamagotchi to FireFox. Users can feed and care for a mini virtual pet. I liked how in their open source CONTRIBUTING.md they added guidelines on how to frame commit messages. I do wonder if in the future, this extension could allow for the virtual pets to retain their levels even after exiting FireFox and returning.

2. [Website Time Tracker](https://github.com/ossd-s25/websiteTimeTracker) allows for users to track their time on any website which could be especially interesting if there was a pop-up telling them they have spent an excess amount of time on a specific site. Within their code I found their code of conduct interesting as it stated "This project adheres to No Code of Conduct. We are all adults. We accept anyone's contributions. Nothing else matters.". This is an unusual code of conduct which allows for a lot of potential innovation and behavior from contributors.
