## Group Work


I now have team members with whom I can work with. We have combined our goals for the semester and are now pursuing work on an open source project in which we can improve our skills in either Javascript or Typescript. An ideal project would be one that has good first issues open, timely communication, and opportunity for growth and creativity.

### Potential Projects
------
- [Abbreve](https://github.com/Njong392/Abbreve/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) was our first choice because of its potential for feature improvements. However, it seems this project is less favorable in terms of both communication and maintenance.

- [Mermaid.Js](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/issues) was also determined to be a good choice because of its many issues and we are still looking into how viable it is as a long-term project.

- [Excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw) is written mostly in Typescript which makes it an interesting challenge.

- [Lucide](https://github.com/lucide-icons/lucide) is also favorable because it uses both Javascript and Typescript and working with vector images is not something I have done before.

### Blockers
------

The main obstacle that my group faces is our ability to make a good solid choice for our project. We are being hesitant with our choice because we want to be able to make a strong commitment and a valuable contribution to whichever project we decide on.

### Pros
------

Throughout this process we have been able to gather projects that while they might not be suitable for a large contribution, would possibly benefit from a smaller contribution. [Abbreve](https://github.com/Njong392/Abbreve/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) is one such project.

Another positive is that our group is making excellent strides in our ability and willingness to communicate well with each other and all members seem eager to be a team and have fun with this journey.
